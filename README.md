# Memory-Gain-Development-Project

ABSTRACT

This project is about the memory game as it is sometimes called, is a popular card game played by children and adults around the world. Good memory is one of the qualities required in order to succeed in it and this memory game helps to increases the functionality of the brain. When it is assumed that the players have perfect memory, the memory game can be seen as a game of strategy. The game is analysed under this assumption and the optimal strategy is found. It is simple and a perfect brain exercise.
BACKGROUND

                                   Brain training games are believed to play a major role in improving cognitive functions. The current study evaluated if Brain training games showed positive impact on attention and memory functions compared with baseline visit in healthy subjects

PROBLEM  STATEMENT
                             
                                   Memory games are a short term boost. A good short term memory can improve a person's long term memory. With many memory games based on spotting differences, or linking two related images, children improve their visual discrimination and build children’s thinking skills, concentration and attention span. This builds children’s persistence and gives children the chance to try new things without fear of failure.

OBJECTIVE
      
                                  To synthesis the best evidence to assess the effectives of game based brain training in improving cognitive function and to evaluate the preferred design features of the intervention. Role of different parts of  brain involved in processing and storage of memory. Role of different central mechanisms in learning and memory.
                    
EXISTING SYSTEM                                         

                                    This is a simple game developed with the help of programming language. The game is played by a single player. The whole process is carried out by making sixteen to twenty five tiles. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The game play rules are very simple, flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match have to match the identical tiles and the process gets repeated. only single player can play this and this is game does not contain many level.
PROPOSED SYSTEM
                                  
                                        To overcome the drawbacks of the existing system, the proposed has been evolved. This system give accessible to play with multiple players. the user can play as many games without any interpretation. It is highly reliable, approximate result from user. The game has been made with expert system. It is a good brain exercise for all age group people.
